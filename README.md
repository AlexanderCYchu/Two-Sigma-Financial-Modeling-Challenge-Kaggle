### What the project is about
I'm interested in financial data. I choose this kaggle challenge as my capstone project in  Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree, to practicing time series, model tuning and financial data.

### Download the dataset
 [https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-modeling/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-modeling/data), put the data file in the same directory, then start the python file.
